# Predicting electricity consumption in Tetouan city using statistical ML and Deep leaning

*Reproduced the result from research paper "[Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Power Consumption Prediction: Case Study of Tetouan City](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8703007)". Use public dataset at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/849/power+consumption+of+tetouan+city).*

In addition, I build ensemble models to check whether its improve performance.

## Language:
Python: sklearn, keras
